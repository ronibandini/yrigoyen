# History

Hipolito Yrigoyen was president of Argentina twice. During the second term, newspapers, articles and cartoons depicted him as weak and senile. The legend says that during this time, his entourage made fake newspapers with altered news. To this day, when some politician in Argentina is not in touch with reality, we usually say “He must be reading the Yirigoyen’s newspaper”
